# Parallelized FDTD Computional Electromagnetics for 3-Dimensional Inverse Design Problems

## _Abstract_
As the increasing demand for the highly efficient optical communications as well as more complex optical systems for Augmented Reality(AR) and Virtual Reality(VR), using simple and intuitive geometries of nanophotonics designs or metasurface desgins to imporve the efficicency of optical components or to achieve specific funcationalies of opticl systems become very difficult since these approaches only explore a small fraction of the possible design. The inverse design using _adjoint method_[1], which uses gradient-based optimization methods, is a promising method that provides an efficient approach to explore the entire space of possible designs and has been used to demonstrate devices that have better efÔ¨Åciencies and novel functionalities. Although this method greatly reduces the computional expense of an electromagnetic simuation, the entire parameter searching space is still large so that most of the current researches fixed the thickness of their designs to simplify their 3-dimensional problem to a 2-dimensional probelm or using a preodic boundary constraint to reduce their design space. However, fixing the thickness of a desgin or limiting a desgin to be a preodic nanostructure might limit the opportunity to explore more possible desgins that might have higher efficiencies and more advanced functionalities. 

In this proposal, I would like to utilize what I have learned in CSCI 596 to do the parallel computing on a FDTD electromagnetic, inverse desgin problem. By doing the spatial decomposition of an inverse desgin probelm, w
